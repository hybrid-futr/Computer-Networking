# Computer Networking

This folder is focused on Cisco at the moment but will grow as I work more closely with different software and hardware vendors. 


Folders: 

Cisco - Large labs built in Packet Tracer for a NetAcad course. 

Homelab - Small labs built in Packet Tracer for a homelab (all Cisco hardware as of 5/10/2021). The real switches and router configurations sill then be implemented and saved here. The idea is to grow the homelab to include multi-vendor solutions and build the pre-labs on GNS3 first instead of Packet Tracer.
